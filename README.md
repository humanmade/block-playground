# Block Development Playground

This project gives you an Altis-powered environment to use for block editor experiments. All script loading should be handled by the plugins, so you're free to focus on block development!

Custom blocks should be created within the [`custom-blocks` mu-plugin](./content/mu-plugins/custom-blocks).
